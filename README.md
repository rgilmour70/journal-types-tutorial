Journal Types Tutorial
======================

This repository contains the HTML, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript code for the [Ithaca College Library tutorial on types of publications](http://ithacalibrary.com/research/journal_types_tut/). 

The content of the tutorial teaches undergrad students the differences between scholarly, trade, and popular publications. 

The tutorial is designed to be visually engaging and uses some of that new-fangled parallax stuff.

Alas, the code in this repository is far from self-sufficient. You will also need a few jQuery goodies:

  * [Stellar.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/) - for parallax goodness
  * [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/) - ties functions to scrolling events
  * [Easing](http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/) - advanced jQuery easing functions
  * [Colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) - modal windows

You'll also want to grab a copy of [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).

If you're not familiar with Sass, you should consult [the Sass site](http://sass-lang.com/) and get yourself a compiler to turn your Sass into CSS. Personally, I use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), but [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) is also popular (Mac only).

Finally, to get a good idea of how all this is put together, you might want to look at [this fantastic article by Aaron Lumsden on tuts+](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-parallax-scrolling-website-using-stellarjs--webdesign-7307), which was the design basis for this tutorial and from which much of the code is derived.
